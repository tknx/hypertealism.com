*To cut to the chase - **Rhodia Script MultiPen** is the one I like the best.*

Recently I have been trying out a few multipens when I have been studying Japanese.

I wanted to be able to easily mark new vocab and other items in red and maybe do some other color coding here and there.

The other criteria was that it has to be a nice thin line since I am often writing furigana as well.

I bought several multipens from [Yoseka Stationary](yosekastationery.com) and Amazon:

1. Uni Style Fit Meister with 0.38 gel refills
2. Pilot Coleto 1000 with 0.3 gel refills
3. Rhodia Multi 3-in-1 Script 0.5

The short answer: the Uni Style Fit absolutely sucks and the Pilot Coleto at least hits tolerable.

### Uni Style Fit Meister - F rank

This can hold five different refills. It is a long barrel that gets somewhat thinner up top and has a clear window at the bottom to see which ink you have in which slot. I loaded all of mine in rainbow order starting with black and then ROYGBIV.

The problems are numerous.
1. The body is a bit too thick for me
2. The body feels ridiculously cheap. Like way below the standard of the cheapest pen you have ever bought. No think cheaper. Thin flexy plastic that is very smooth and doesn't provide good grip at all
3. The window is covered by your hands when you are writing, so changing colors is tedious. Eventually I would expect to memorize what is where... if I was going to actually use this thing.
4. The detente on the ink selection levers are weak and hard to get to lock in. They release if you look at them funny.
5. The clip is one of the levers, which means it feels wobbly and flimsy all the time.
6. The amount of spring in the tip is distracting. They don't feel locked into place very well as all

Writing is pretty much the same as my favorite Signo 0.38. So the ink is top notch. But this pen absolutely sucks to use. I hate it. Like absolutele hate it.

I may just buy a Style Fit single body just to use up the inks or 3d print something. Just absolutely awful pen.

### Pilot Coleto - C-rank

This pen hits the level of being perfectly average in build quality. Overall it is a much better thought out pen:

1. The refills are designed with color tabs on the top so the selection levers match the ink color. This is brilliant.
2. Loading it is a bit weird since you flip open the top and load them downwards.
3. The detente is decent and easier to get a selection to stick

The ink refills are similar to the Hi-Tec C, so solid if not Signo level.

### Rhodia Script MultiPen cf9371 - B-rank

This one is significantly more expensive than the other two. And visual impressions are good. It is a handsome looking pen.

You pick it up and it feels a bit light, and it does rattle slightly if you shake it as the parts move about.

Writing though is pretty wonderful. The stock 0.5s ballpoints write pretty thinly and the pencil has a good action and line.

Negatives are few:

1. There is no indicator at all of which tip you are on except they banded the tip of the red pen.

2. The rotary action to select tips is really rough and unrefined. Like really unpleasant to switch between. One day I might take it apart and see if it can be lubricated and cleaned up.

3. Honestly I don't love integrated pencils, I'd rather have another color ink. I will have to see if the pencil module can be exchanged for a blue ink at some point.
