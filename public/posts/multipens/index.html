  <h1>Multipens</h1>
  <time datetime=2024-09-13T13:31:23-0700 class="post-date">Fri, Sep 13, 2024</time>
  <p>Recently I have been trying out a few multipens when I have been studying Japanese.</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to easily mark new vocab and other items in red and maybe do some other color coding here and there.</p>
<p>The other criteria was that it has to be a nice thin line since I am often writing furigana as well.</p>
<p>So I bought two well-regarded, inexpensive multipens from Yoseka Stationary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uni Style Fit Meister with 0.38 gel refills</li>
<li>Pilot Coleto 1000 with 0.3 gel refills</li>
</ol>
<p>The short answer: the Uni Style Fit absolutely sucks and the Pilot Coleto at least hits tolerable.</p>
<h3 id="uni-style-fit-meister---f-rank">Uni Style Fit Meister - F rank</h3>
<p>This can hold five different refills. It is a long barrel that gets somewhat thinner up top and has a clear window at the bottom to see which ink you have in which slot. I loaded all of mine in rainbow order starting with black and then ROYGBIV.</p>
<p>The problems are numerous.</p>
<ol>
<li>The body is a bit too thick for me</li>
<li>The body feels ridiculously cheap. Like way below the standard of the cheapest pen you have ever bought. No think cheaper. Thin flexy plastic that is very smooth and doesn&rsquo;t provide good grip at all</li>
<li>The window is covered by your hands when you are writing, so changing colors is tedious. Eventually I would expect to memorize what is where&hellip; if I was going to actually use this thing.</li>
<li>The detente on the ink selection levers are weak and hard to get to lock in. They release if you look at them funny.</li>
<li>The clip is one of the levers, which means it feels wobbly and flimsy all the time.</li>
<li>The amount of spring in the tip is distracting. They don&rsquo;t feel locked into place very well as all</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing is pretty much the same as my favorite Signo 0.38. So the ink is top notch. But this pen absolutely sucks to use. I hate it. Like absolutele hate it.</p>
<p>I may just buy a Style Fit single body just to use up the inks or 3d print something. Just absolutely awful pen.</p>
<h3 id="pilot-coleto---c-rank">Pilot Coleto - C-rank</h3>
<p>This pen hits the level of being perfectly average in build quality. Overall it is a much better thought out pen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The refills are designed with color tabs on the top so the selection levers match the ink color. This is brilliant.</li>
<li>Loading it is a bit weird since you flip open the top and load them downwards.</li>
<li>The detente is decent and easier to get a selection to stick</li>
</ol>
<p>The ink refills are similar to the Hi-Tec C, so solid if not Signo level.</p>
